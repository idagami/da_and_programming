implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.
Users can encode or decode messages by shifting letters through the alphabet.
Non-alphabet characters are preserved, and shifts wrap correctly using modulo logic.
The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple encrypt/decrypt operations per session.
