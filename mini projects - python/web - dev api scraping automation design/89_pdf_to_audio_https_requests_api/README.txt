This project converts PDF files into spoken audio using Python.
It demonstrates two different Text-to-Speech (TTS) approaches:

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) – cloud-based, higher-quality voices
pyttsx3 – offline, system-based speech engine

Both scripts extract text from a PDF using PyPDF2 and generate an MP3 audio file.

Must activate venv.
