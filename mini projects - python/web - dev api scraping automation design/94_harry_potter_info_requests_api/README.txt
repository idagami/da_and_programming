Flask web application that explores the Harry Potter universe using multiple public APIs.
It allows users to browse books, movies, spells, discover release anniversaries, 
and even send email notifications when a Harry Potter book was released on today’s date.

The app combines API consumption, data processing, templating, randomness, and email automation in one project.
