This project is an automated web scraper and notifier that uses Selenium to extract cruise deals from VacationToGo.com, processes the data into a structured format using Pandas, saves it as a CSV file, and automatically sends the top deals via email.

The system simulates real user interactions (clicks, filters, sorting, login handling) 
and builds a structured dataset from a dynamic website.
