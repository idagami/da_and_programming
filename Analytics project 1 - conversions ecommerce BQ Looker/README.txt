This project analyzes Google Analytics 4 (GA4) e-commerce events using BigQuery SQL and visualizes the results in Looker Studio.

The goal is to:
Reconstruct user sessions
Track users through the e-commerce funnel
Analyze traffic sources, devices, and geographies
Provide a clean dataset ready for BI reporting

The project is built on the public dataset: bigquery-public-data.ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce

GA4 data is event-based, not session-based. This project demonstrates the ability to:
Reconstruct sessions correctly
Handle nested GA4 schemas
Translate raw analytics data into business-ready insights
