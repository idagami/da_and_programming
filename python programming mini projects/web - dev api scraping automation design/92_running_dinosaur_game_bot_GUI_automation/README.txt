This project is a Python bot that automatically plays the Chrome Dinosaur Game using real-time screen capture and pixel analysis.
The bot detects obstacles (cacti and birds) and reacts by jumping or ducking with dynamically adjusted timing as the game speed increases.

Two versions are included:
Cactus-only bot
Advanced bot with cactus + bird detection
Both versions restart automatically after failure.
