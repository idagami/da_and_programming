Classic Space Invaders game with a twist: defend your cannon using an Iron Dome system.
Players control a cannon, shoot invaders, and intercept falling bombs with anti-missile projectiles.
Invaders move and drop bombs randomly; cannon has limited lives.
Score increases by hitting invaders or intercepting bombs; hitting bombs or being hit decreases lives.
Game ends when all invaders are destroyed (win) or cannon loses all lives (game over).
